       <h2> HTML <h2>  
       <p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it uses a system of tags and elements to define the structure and meaning of web content. </p>
     
       <h2> CSS </h2>
       <p> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. It dictates how HTML elements are displayed on a web page, controlling aspects such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. CSS is a fundamental component of web development, working in conjunction with HTML (which provides the structure) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity).</p>
     
       <h2> JAVASCRIPT </h2>
       <p> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily known for its role in making web pages interactive and dynamic. It is the scripting language of the web, and is fully integrated with HTML and CSS.</p>
